# Ping by T3 Community Driven Docuemntation 

[**Ping**](https://ping.t3.gg) is the best way to make live content with a group. Stand out from other creators with higher quality and lower latency.

This documentation site is in no way an official the documentation of T3 nor is it run or contributed to by the team at T3.  It is an independant entity and is not affilated with T3.  Do not contact T3 if there are errors here.  You can tweet at [**Dax**](https://www.twitter.com/haydenaylor) on twitter instead. This is here because another developer got tired of asking the same questions over and over again in discord and the internal team got tired of answering them. If you want access to the offical T3 tools [**FAQ**](https://ping.t3.gg/info/help) can be used to get answers to your questions.

Ping is currently in a closed paid beta for content creators only.  For additional information please visit [**Ping**](https://ping.t3.gg)
