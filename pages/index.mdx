# Ping Community Driven Documentation 

[**Ping**](https://ping.t3.gg) is the best way to make live content with a group. Stand out from other creators with higher quality and lower latency.

This documentation site is in no way an official the documentation of Ping nor is it run or contributed to by the team at Ping Labs.  It is an independant entity and is not affilated with Ping Labs.  Do not contact Ping Labs if there are errors here.  You can tweet at [**Dax**](https://www.twitter.com/haydenaylor) on twitter instead. This is here because another developer got tired of asking the same questions over and over again in discord and the internal team got tired of answering them. If you want access to the offical Ping Labs [**FAQ**](https://ping.t3.gg/info/help) can be used to get answers to your questions.
